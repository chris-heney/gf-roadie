Left off / Next Steps:

gf-roadie.js:
 - Adding Quantity and pickup_after variables

class-gf-roadie.php: 
 - Add <input> number for quantity

class-api-gf-roadie.php
 - Replace endpoint & token with settings call
 - Replace hard-coded values for estimate
 - Create function for create-shipment; to be called by cron

Will need to create a cronable script file as well, to bootstrap the
calls to roadie to create-shipment.  Roadie's create-shipment should
be able to be accessed from both the cron script as well as WP Hook.

Thought process:
Add to the entry meta data an araray of named addresses which will
be looped through monthly on cron;

Psudeo code:
<?php

$settings = get_settings();
$form_id = rgar( $settings, 'roadie_order_form' );
$orders = gf_get_entries([ 'form_id' => $form_id ]);

foreach ($entries as $entry){
    
    $shipment_enabled = gform_get_meta( $entry['id'], 'shipment_enabled' );
    
    if ( ! $shipment_enabled ){
        continue;
    }

    $addresses = gform_get_meta( $entry['id'], 'roadie_addresses' );

    if ( ! $addresses ) {
        continue;
    }

    foreach ($addresses as $address){
        sleep(1);   // 1 second delay

    }
}
